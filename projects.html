    <div class="panel">
    <p>The <a href="https://boo2108.wixsite.com/senior-design">SpiderShoe</a> is an engineered shoe attachment that is design to catch you when you fall. 
    Aimed at aiding those struggling with vertigo and other balance-related issues, some of the 
    most common health issues that adult face in the US. The SpiderShoe detects when its wearer 
    begins to tip over, immediately deploys four legs to provide support to the wearer. These 
    legs extend the wearer's base of support and allow them to regain their balance without 
    suffering from a potentially dangerous tumble. </p>
