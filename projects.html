<h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Here are some of my past projects.</p>

    <button class="accordion">[Undisclosed] - National Institutes of Health Project</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Can't wait to share more info - Update soon!</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">SpiderShoe - Senior Design Project</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>The <a href="https://boo2108.wixsite.com/senior-design">SpiderShoe</a> is an engineered shoe 
    attachment that is design to catch you when you fall. Aimed at aiding those struggling with vertigo 
    and other balance-related issues, some of the most common health issues that adult face in the US. 
    The SpiderShoe detects when its wearer begins to tip over, immediately deploys four legs to provide 
    support to the wearer. These legs extend the wearer's base of support and allow them to regain 
    their balance without suffering from a potentially dangerous tumble. </p>

    <button class="accordion">ArcGIS Maps/Scripts - ArcGIS Course Assignments</button>
    <div class="panel">

    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Automated Robotic Linkage System - Machine Design Project</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>This group project involved designing, fabricating, and controlling a four-bar linkage mechanism 
    capable of pressing randomly illuminated arcade buttons in a rapid sequence. The goal was to optimize 
    both speed and accuracy using an Arduino Uno and tuning a PID controller. This system was modeled 
    and analyzed in SOLIDWORKS, then manufactured piece-by-piece and wired/coded integrated for automated 
    actuation. </p>

    <button class="accordion">Balancing Backpack Concept - Columbia Hackathon</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Developed during a 24-hour school hackathon, this concept/prototype explores the use of a capstan-based 
    folding mechanism to provide balance and counteract an impending fall. The design integrates a system 
    of specifically-positioned rotating weights inside a backpack that spins in the opposite direction of
    a fall, counteracting inertia and helping the wearer regain balance. The prototype aimed to demonstrate 
    how compact mechanical actuation could be applied to wearable safety technology for improved motion 
    control and fall prevention.</p>
